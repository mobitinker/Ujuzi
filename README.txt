Ujuzi a mobile application to connect people with nearby social services.

Ujuzi uses Java (J2ME) technologies. Ujuzi specifically does not use heavyweight UI libraries as its target is low-end Java-enabled mobile devices. The compiled JAR is approximately 80kb and thus should run on the simplest Java enabled phones.

Ujuzi requres the use of the NanoXML library. NanoXML is an XML parser for Java and is distributed under the  zlib/libpng license, which is OSS (Open Source Software) compliant. NanoXML is not included with this distribtion. NanoXML may be downloaded from: http://devkix.com/nanoxml.php

The Ujuzi project uses the XML API provided by One Economy Corporation, an NGO that operates The Beehive website (http://www.thebeehive.org/). The Beehive is a portal of important life topics aimed at low-income Internet users. Listings provided by the API are categorized using the AIRS taxonomy. For more information on the API, please see README-OEAPI.txt.
